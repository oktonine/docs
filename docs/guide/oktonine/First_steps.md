### Define your goals

Because VuePress applications are server-rendered in Node.js when generating static builds, any Vue usage must conform to the [universal code requirements](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/universal.html). In short, make sure to only access Browser / DOM APIs in `beforeMount` or `mounted` hooks.

### Prepare your competency frameworks
If you are using or demoing components that are not SSR friendly (for example containing custom directives), you can wrap them inside the built-in `<ClientOnly>` component:

### Create your users


### Prepare you methodologies


### Prepare you projects

### Assign methodologies and competency frameworks to projects


### Align competencies with activities 


### Assign students to projects

### Help and coach students


### Evaluate students
