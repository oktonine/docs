# Challenges types

At Oktonine, there are three types of challenges that can be created by a company representative. The challenge type depends on how the company wants to collaborate with schools.

Challenges proposed by companies (outside a call-for-challenges) are only displayed at Oktonine's ``ProjectStore`` 

## Private challenge

If a company wants to collaborate with a specific teacher within a specific school, it should publish its challenge as ``Private``. The comapny needs to add this teacher as a collaborator of the challenge.

Doing so, the challenge will only be visible for this teacher.

## Public challenge

If a company wants to provide a challenge for anyone using Oktonine, it should publish its challenge as ``Public``. The company don't have to specify a collaborator.

Doing so, the challenge will be visible for everyone using Oktonine and the company won't be able to see who is working on its challenge.

## On-demand challenge

If the company wants to work with students and teachers from any school, without preferences, it can define its challenge as ``On-demand``.

The company will receive applications from teachers to collaborate with them.
If the company accept a teacher's request, they can convert the challenge into a ``Private`` one.
