# Users management

In this section, you will learn how to create Oktonine accounts for students, teachers, and professionals (company's representatives)

## Student accounts
Students accounts need to be created by a school's manager or by a teacher. 

There are two methods for students accounts creation:

### 1- Creation via file import
To import a group of students : 
- Go to `Users` in the left menu and click on `Import students form an xlsx file`

- The file needs to respect the format that you can downlod from the next screen (First name ; Last name; Email	Password; Group; Department). 

- Upload the file, select your institution and click on "Create Batch of Students"

- If the operation is successfully executed, you'll receive confirmation emails and you will get a screen like that :

- You can verify this operation results by clicking on the `Users` element, from the left menu

- To give students access to their accounts, you can either communicate the defined passwords individually, or by asking them to click on Forgotten password (to define a new password before the first authentification)

Note : By creating students using the file import operation, they will be automatically attached to your institute.


### 2- Manual creation
You can also create an account for a student manually, by following these steps:

- First, go to the `Users` element in the left menu, and click on `Create a user`

- Fill the form and click on `Creat User` if you only need to create one account or click on `Create and Add another` if you want to create more than one student

- The profil is created and you will get this window

At this level you only created a generic user and not a student profile. You need to attach the created user to your institute and to give him a student role.

- Click on `Institutes` then on `Join an institute` to attach the created student to your institute.
