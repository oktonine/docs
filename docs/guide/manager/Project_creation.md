# Create and manage projects within the school environment

To make your students work on a project, you have two ways to do it within Oktonine:

- Create a project from a real-life challenge provided by a company through a `call-for-challenges` (you can do the same thing through the `ProjectStore`)

- Create your own project within the institute environment.

## Create a project from a challenge

- Go to a `Call-for-challenges` you created (you can do the same thing through the `ProjectStore`)

- Go to the `Challenges` tab
- Select and open the challenge you want to work on

Click on `Use the challenge` to convert it from a challenge to a project. It's only when the challenge becomes a project that you will be able to assign students to it.

Give a name to the created project and make it part of your school.

Once the project is created, don't forget to click on `Show` to make it visible within your institute.

## Create a new project

If you want your students to work on internal projects that you create by yourself, go to the `Projects` element at the left menu, and click on `create a project.`

Now, you have a project created by yourself or from the `call-for-challenges`; you have to do some additional actions.

## Assign a methodology to a project


To add a methodology to your project, start by opening your project from the `project` element of the left menu.

## Assign collaborators to a project

You need to add all persons part of the project (teachers, coaches, and companies) as collaborators of the project.

## Assign resources to a project

In the same way, you can add resources and documentation that might be helpful for students and coaches working on the project.

## Assign competencies to the different activities of the methodology (inside a project)

In order to be able to correctly attribute the acquired skills by students, you previously need to make the `pedagogical alignment.`
You have to assign one or more competencies for each activity of the methodology. 
To do that, please follow the next steps :

Open the methodology attached to your project.

Open its activities, one by one.

![image](../img/manager/addcompetenciestoproject/addcompetenytoproject2.png)

For each activity, assign the most appropriate competencies.

At the end of this operation, the attached competencies will appear within the project methodology.
