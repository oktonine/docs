# Visualize and manage received challenges from a company

As a teacher you can receive challenges from companies within two locations:

- Inside a call : if you published one and if you asked companies to submit their challenges inside it

- Inside the ProjectStore : If you didn't create a call-for-challenges or if you are looking for public challenges, open to all.
