# Create a call-for-challenges
When you use oktonine to make your students work on real life projects, in collaboration with companies, one of the challenges is to find these projects for you students.

By using Oktonine you can pass through the `projectstore` to find these projects (we talk about that in another section), or you create your own call for challenges, that you can send to companies, this is the subject of this topic.

## Create a call
To create a call for challenges, you need to pass through these steps :

- Click on "calls" in the left menu --> all the calls created by your institution are available here
